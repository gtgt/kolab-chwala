libkolab plugin to access to Kolab groupware data
=================================================

The contained library classes establish a connection to the Kolab server
and manage the access to the Kolab groupware objects stored in various
IMAP folders. For reading and writing these objects, the PHP bindings of
the libkolabxml library are used.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
* libkolabxml PHP bindings
  - kolabformat.so loaded into PHP
  - kolabformat.php placed somewhere in the include_path
* PEAR: HTTP/Request2
* PEAR: Net/URL2

* Optional for old format support:
  Horde Kolab_Format package and all of its dependencies
  which are at least Horde_(Browser,DOM,NLS,String,Utils)


INSTALLATION
------------
To use local cache you need to create a dedicated table in Roundcube's database.
To do so, execute the SQL commands in SQL/<yourdatabase>.sql


CONFIGURATION
-------------
The following options can be configured in Roundcube's main config file
or a local config file (config.inc.php) located in the plugin folder.

// Enable caching of Kolab objects in local database
$rcmail_config['kolab_cache'] = true;

// Optional override of the URL to read and trigger Free/Busy information of Kolab users
// Defaults to https://<imap-server->/freebusy
$rcmail_config['kolab_freebusy_server'] = 'https://<some-host>/<freebusy-path>';

// Set this option to disable SSL certificate checks when triggering Free/Busy (enabled by default)
$rcmail_config['kolab_ssl_verify_peer'] = false;
