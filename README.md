INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
======================

This package contains required PHP libraries as well as the Roundcube Framework
placed in lib/ext directory. In case you're using a package version
with lib/ext directory empty make sure all dependencies are installed
on your system. These are Roundcube Framework and its dependencies plus
PEAR::HTTP_Request2 and PEAR::Net_URL2 packages. Additionally Smarty v3 need
to be installed.

1. Create local config

The configuration for this service inherits basic options from the Roundcube
config. To make that available, symlink the Roundcube config files
(main.inc.php and db.inc.php) into the local config/ directory.

2. Give write access for the webserver user to the logs, cache and temp folders:

$ chown <www-user> logs
$ chown <www-user> cache
$ chown <www-user> temp

3. Execute database initialization scripts from doc/SQL/ on Roundcube database.

4. Optionally, configure your webserver to point to the 'public_html' directory of this
package as document root.


CREATING BACKEND-DRIVER
=======================

Chwala API supports creation of different storage backends.
It is possible to create a driver class that will store files on
any storage e.g. local filesystem. As for now it is possible to use
only one storage at a time.

There's currently one reference driver in Chwala - the Kolab driver.
You can find it in lib/kolab directory. It's based on Roundcube Framework
and plugins. The Kolab way is to store files in IMAP.
The main driver file is lib/kolab/kolab_file_storage.php.

To create a new driver you need to:

1. Create driver directory as lib/<driver_name>. This directory will be
   added to PHP's include path.

2. Create lib/<driver_name>/<driver_name>_file_storage.php file.
   This file should define a class <driver_name>_file_storage which
   will implement file_storage interface (defined in lib/file_storage.php).

3. To change the driver set 'fileapi_backend' option to the driver name
   in main configuration file. Default is 'kolab'.


Driver initialization
---------------------

Driver object is initialized in file_api::api_init() method.
After the object instance is created we call configure() method.


Driver methods
--------------

1. configure - Is used to configure the driver.

2. authenticate - Is used to authenticate a user in authenticate
   request.

3. capabilities - Is supposed to return capabilities and limitations
   (like max. upload size) supported by the driver.

Other methods are self explanatory and well documented in
interface class file. API documentation can be generated
using phpDocumentor (http://phpdoc.org).
